# Editing with AI

This template is optimized for use with Artificial Intelligence assistants (like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, or Claude).

## Prompts for the Assistant

You can ask the assistant to:
- "Create a new chapter about Thermodynamics."
- "Add a matplotlib graph to visualize this function."
- "Correct the style of this paragraph."

The assistant knows the project structure thanks to the `Agent.md` file.

## Prompt Example
> "Create a code cell that plots the standard normal distribution using matplotlib."

The AI will give you the code and you just have to run it or include it in your book.
