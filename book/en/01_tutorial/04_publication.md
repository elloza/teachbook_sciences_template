# Web Publication

Publication is done automatically through **GitHub Pages**.

## Steps to publish

1. Ensure your repository is public (or you have access to GitHub Pages in private).
2. Make changes to your content.
3. Save changes with a **Commit** and **Push** to the main branch (`main`).
4. A "GitHub Action" will run automatically and build your book.
5. In a few minutes, you will see your updated book at your repository URL (configured in Settings > Pages).
